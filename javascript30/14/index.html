    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one day
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',

    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    //console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
